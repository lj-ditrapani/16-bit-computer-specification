General
-------

- 16-bit CPU
- Program ROM 64 KWords = 128 KB = 1 M-bit
- Data ROM 32 KWords = 64 KB = 512 K-bit
- RAM 32 KWords = 64 KB = 512 K-bit
- 8 MHz clock
- 4 clocks per LOD or STR instruction
- 2 clocks for all other instructions
- 2-4 Million instructions per second (MIPS)
- It can do 4 million memory accesses (reads or writes) per second.
- Physical implementations should meet above 2-4 MIPS performance.  So if the
  implementation requires max 4 clocks per instruction, then the clock
  should run at 8 MHz.  If the implementation requires max 8 clocks
  per instruction, the clock should run at 16 MHz.

Example of implementation that uses a max of 2 clocks per instruction (8 MHz).

```
    Triple ported register file
    (2 reads, 1 write per clock)
    CPLD like Control
    10 function ALU (4 control bits)

    Regular (2 clock)
    Fetch instruction (memory read)       1 clock
    Decode & Reg read & ALU & Reg write   1 clock

    STR (4 clocks)
    Fetch instruction (memory read)       1 clock
    Decode & Reg read                     1 clock
    Memory write                          1 clock
    idle                                  1 clock

    LOD (4 clocks)
    Fetch instruction (memory read)       1 clock
    Decode & Reg read                     1 clock
    Memory read                           1 clock
    reg write                             1 clock
