Ideas
-----
- Rename END to IDL?
- Rename BRV to BRN
    - never support carry or overflow
    - or could accommodate carry only, but not overflow
    - would want carry+overflow for calculator, spread sheet, accounting, BigInt
- Keep BRV and add BRF back in
    - to allow carry & overflow
    - could define it, but just have BRF unimplemented for a while?

- define frame skip
