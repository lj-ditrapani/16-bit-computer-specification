- Cycle count
    - separate
        - true physical implementation options
            - copy stuff to vdp
            - Pin out
        - required physical specs
            - copy stuff to vdp (what can be changed)
        - or just don't touch stuff you shouldn't
            - so that multiple implementations work
    - Bus access is interleaved between CPU & VDP
        - even clocks = CPU, odd clocks = VDP

Ideas
-----
- Rename END to IDL?
- Rename BRV to BRN
    - never support carry or overflow
    - or could accommodate carry only, but not overflow
    - would want carry+overflow for calculator, spread sheet, accounting, BigInt
- Keep BRV and add BRF back in
    - to allow carry & overflow
    - could define it, but just have BRF unimplemented for a while?


- 512 tiles: 256 bg 128 fg
    - so 3 KW of tile ram space instead of 2 KW
- 208 words of ram for color cells
- Io ram for frame count down to next frame interrupt
- Up to 60 fps
- New frame interrupt
- CI cpu_interrupt and AI apu_interrupt
- CI sets CPU PC to copy address. Program rom must then copy over data to io regs. Less than 3.8 ms.
- AI sets CPU PC to program loop entry point address.  And pauses CPU and give APU control of bus.
- so only 4 KW of RAM space is reserved.  The rest of RAM is open for the program to use how it wants.
- add audio
