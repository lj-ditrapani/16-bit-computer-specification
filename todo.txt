- Cycle count
    - separate
        - true physical implementation options
            - copy stuff to vdp
            - Pin out
        - required physical specs
            - copy stuff to vdp (what can be changed)
        - or just don't touch stuff you shouldn't
            - so that multiple implementations work
    - Bus access is interleaved between CPU & VDP
        - even clocks = CPU, odd clocks = VDP

Ideas
-----
- Rename END to IDL?
- Rename BRV to BRN
    - never support carry or overflow
    - or could accomodate carry only, but not overflow
    - would want carry+overflow for calculator, spread sheet, accounting, BigInt
- Keep BRV and add BRF back in
    - to allow carry & overflow
    - could define it, but just have BRF unimplemented for a while?
